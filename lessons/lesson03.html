    <h1>Lesson 3: Hierarchy of Controls</h1>
  </header>

  <section>
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>How to prioritize hazard controls: Elimination → Substitution → Engineering → Administrative → PPE.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Key Topics</h2>
    <ul>
    <li>Elimination</li>
<li>Substitution</li>
<li>Engineering controls</li>
<li>Administrative controls</li>
<li>PPE</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Detailed Content</h2>
    <p>The hierarchy guides choosing the most effective control. Elimination or substitution removes the hazard;
     engineering isolates people from the hazard (guards, ventilation). Administrative controls change how people work (training, signage).
     PPE is the last line of defence.</p>
  <h3>Beginner Level</h3><p>Foundational knowledge: definitions, simple examples, and immediate safe actions.</p><ul><li>Understand key terms and hazards.</li><li>Recognise common warning signs and PPE.</li><li>Follow simple safe work steps and reporting.</li></ul><h3>Intermediate Level</h3><p>Procedures, permits, tools and supervision: practical application and routine controls.</p><ul><li>Implement standard operating procedures and checklists.</li><li>Perform basic risk assessments and use control hierarchy.</li><li>Participate in drills and maintain records.</li></ul><h3>Advanced Level</h3><p>Planning, technical controls, leadership, permit-to-work systems, incident investigation and training others.</p><ul><li>Design or select engineering controls and review safety systems.</li><li>Lead incident investigations and root cause analysis.</li><li>Develop emergency/rescue plans and deliver training.</li></ul><h4>Permits & Rescue</h4><p>Always use permit-to-work where required. Prepare rescue plans, equipment and trained rescuers before high-risk tasks.</p></section>

  <section>
    <h2>Example / Case</h2>
    <p>A solvent-based cleaning process is replaced with a water-based alternative to remove the hazard.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Checklist</h2>
    <div class="checklist">
    <ul>
    <li>Always try to eliminate hazards first</li>
<li>Use engineering controls for long-term safety</li>
<li>Train staff on administrative controls</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Short Quiz</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>Which control is most effective?</li>
<li>When is PPE used?</li>
<li>Give an example of engineering control.</li>
    </ol>
    <p><em>Answers at bottom.</em></p>

  <section>
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Apply the hierarchy; aim at permanent fixes rather than relying on PPE.</p>
